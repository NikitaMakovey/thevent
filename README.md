# ThEvent is the event platform for everyone

## Overview

This project is presented as a platform for any of us: organizers, speakers, volunteers, participants in events and conferences. On the platform, you can become either an ordinary participant or an organizer of a large event - it all depends on your achievements and competencies.

In addition, each user can create their own profile, describing their competencies and achievements. He is able to receive feedback in his karma and, directly, in profile, attending more and more events. For organizers and speakers, their profile can act as a resume or as a portfolio.

Our platform supports every person who wants to become an organizer or speaker - for this, the main moderators are provided who process all your applications.

## Functional Description

It all starts with the entrance to the site. You - as a guest - can view all upcoming events. You need to register on the platform, which will allow you to get more functionality - participation and registration at events, registration of your profile. At this stage, you are a member. Increase your rating by participating in various events, because each event allows you to receive a certain number of points in the piggy bank of your skills. How to take the first step? It's simple - you should submit an application with one click on the event page, this will allow volunteers to take you to the event, giving you a badge of a participant or speaker.

You took the first step, but you have problems with the organization of your time? For you, we have created a personal calendar on our platform - track and view all the events for which you have registered.

Do you have any questions about your role? Yes, you are right, on our platform you can have several roles: participant, volunteer, speaker, organizer and even moderator of events. In addition to these roles, there are such people on the platform as the main moderators - they check all requests for organizing events and conferences, which allows filtering through the prism of the platform rules (you can also familiarize yourself with it on our platform).
